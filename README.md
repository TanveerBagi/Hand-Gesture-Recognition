Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV & MediaPipe 🖐️
This is a real-time hand gesture recognition system that detects and classifies various hand gestures using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The system recognizes gestures like Hello, Goodbye, Peace, Thumbs Up, and more using a webcam.

The system is designed to recognize gestures like Hello, Goodbye, Peace, Thumbs Up, Yes, No, and more, making it a perfect starting point for interactive human-computer interfaces. The gestures are classified based on the positions of the hand landmarks, such as the thumb, index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers.

This project demonstrates the potential of computer vision for creating intuitive gesture-based controls without the need for external hardware or special setups.
